### Did:
* a program using TDD for the first time
* used pathlib extensively
* learned how to manage paths
* learned that fedora does not have python3.14 yet and i cannot use 
    pathlib's copy and move functions, so i used shutil
* logging
* tests
* docstrings
* the whole package
* i would like this program to be have more functionality, but i do not think
  that spending more time on this project would bring more benefit than doing
  other projects, so i am going to leave it how it is.
