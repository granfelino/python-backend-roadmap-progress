# Progress-tracking repository

This repository serves as a reflection point for me & whoever is looking at it, 
on how I am managing my progress on becoming a Python backend developer :)

### What's here:
* `reflections/` folder contains reflecions from every project & a link to its repository
* `roadmap.md` is the roadmap I am following to learn and progress

:)
